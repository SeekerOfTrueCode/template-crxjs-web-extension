# Template crxjs web extension

Simple template made to simplify the work with crxjs library to quickly make / prototype the easily deployable web extensions.

# TODO:

## Simple template

- Fix `offscreen.html` which doesn't render imported script `offscreen.ts`
- (?) Add storybook
- (?) Figure out how to put "popup.html" inside public/pages without breaking building process.
  
## Complex template (code-structure wise / architecture wise)

- Layered structure
- Dependency injection (perhaps)

Legend:
(?) - good to have but not must to have
